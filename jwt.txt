Explain JWT in approx and prove it's top 3 benefits.

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is JSON Object which is used to securely transfer information over the web. 
It can be used for authentication system and can also be used for information exchange. JWT defines 
the structure of information we are sending from one party to the another, and it comes in two forms
1. Serialized 2. Deserialized. The Serialized approach is mainly used to transfer the data through the 
network with each request and response. While the deserialized approach is used to read and write 
data to the web token. The key property of JWTs is that in order to confirm if they are valid we only 
need to look at the token itself. We don't have to contact a third-party service or keep JWTs in-memory 
between requests to confirm that the claim they carry is valid this is because they carry a 
Message Authentication Code or MAC.

Benefits
1. More compact: JSON is less verbose than XML, so when it is encoded, a JWT is smaller than a SAML token. 
   This makes JWT a good choice to be passed in HTML and HTTP environments.

2. More secure: JWTs can use a public/private key pair in the form of an X.509 certificate for signing. A JWT 
   can also be symmetrically signed by a shared secret using the HMAC algorithm and while SAML tokens can use 
   public/private key pairs like JWT, signing XML with XML Digital Signature without introducing obscure security 
   holes is very difficult when compared to the simplicity of signing JSON.

3. More common: JSON parsers are common in most programming languages because they map directly to objects. Conversely, 
   XML doesn't have a natural document-to-object mapping. This makes it easier to work with JWT than SAML assertions.

4. Easier to process: JWT is used at internet scale. This means that it is easier to process on user's devices 
   especially on mobile.
